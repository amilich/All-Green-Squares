# Auto GitHub Pusher

Automatically pushes a minor change to every listed GitHub repository. Put the path.txt file in your home directory with paths to GitHub repositories. If you have not set your global config for GitHub, modify the script to "echo $NAME" and "echo $PW." Lastly, if you want the script to run daily, put the path to autopush.sh in the cron.sh file.
